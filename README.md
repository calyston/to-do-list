This project is a to do list which is generated through user input.

## Technologies Used

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GIT, Bash.

## Personal Learnings

In this project I learnt how to create fully functional buttons using JavaScript, and how to use animations and CSS alongside JavaScript. I also became more familiar with using switch cases, and working with selectors and event listeners. Although the to do list maker is a simple project, it is a very useful project for practicing JavaScript.
